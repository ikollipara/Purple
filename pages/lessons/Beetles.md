# Beetles

## Engage: How do you clean your room? 

Are you a roller, tunnuler, or dweller?



**Rollers:** If you clean your room by categorizing your items into neat balls and putting them in their separate compartments…

**Tunnelers:** if you clean your room by stuffing all your stuff under the bed… 

**Dwellers:** if you don’t clean your room at all and instead enjoy the mess… 

**Just like there are different ways to clean your room, dung beetles have different behaviors** 

>What is meant by cleaning your room? It may sound gross, but dung beetles recycle waste left behind by other organisms. 
>1. Dung beetles are extremely beneficial to the environment! 
>2. While it may take other organisms days, maybe even years to clean their rooms, beetles do it in only 48 hours! 
>3. They make the world a less smelly place to live…otherwise we’d be overrun by flies, parasites and pests that also spend their time in dung piles. 


**Without looking up a picture: what do you think dung beetles would need to look like?**

- What features would they need to have to do the work they do? 
- Where would dung beetles live?

There are a variety of beetles. There are ground beetles, leaf beetles bark beetles and many more!

Based on these names, what places would we be able to find these beetles? 
- What do you think they eat?
- What kind of habitat would they enjoy? (Hint: this is related to what they eat)


## Go Outside:
Go on a beetle hunt - There is a huge variety of beetles, you just have to look for them!

1. Watch and observe beetle behavior (visible actions)
2. Connect an observation of behavior with one of the following:
    - an observation of the environment surrounding the organism
    - an observation of a characteristic structure belonging to the organism
    - Ex: the beetle moved (behavior) its long antennae (structure).

## Questions:
- Did the beetle's behavior have anything to do with its surroundings? What about the stuctures on its body?
- How many living things are there?
- How many nonliving things are there?
- Describe the interactions between the living and nonliving things.
