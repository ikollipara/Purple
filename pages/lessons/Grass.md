# Grass

## Engage: Monoculture vs Diversity

Think of your favorite candy (m&ms, skittles, etc.)

- Why is it your favorite? 
- Is it because it combines all of your favorite things? Is it the combination of peanut and chocolate or perhaps sweet and sour that makes the perfect blend of flavor in your mouth?
- The truth is - we as human beings love diversity. Nobody wants to eat the same meal day in and day out, and although we have routine, variety is the "spice of life."
- So then, how does nature mirror the diversity God has given us?
    - We are blessed with different types of nature: trees, grass, animals, so forth
    - We are also blessed with an **incredible diversity** within even one living thing - Like you!

So how does this apply to grass?

- First of all there are sooo many types of grasses and for the most part, we tend to ignore their diversity and just how cool the difference between grass species is.
- Fun Fact: 20% of the earth is grass! 


"ITS CORN" - (the big lump with knobs) - is a grass!

## Go Outside: 

**Pull a stalk of grass out of the ground carefully to preserve its roots**
Materials: A tape measure, pen and paper
- Measure the length of the roots 
- Observe what soil it's in and surrounding organisms
- Have fun with friendly competition - who can find the tallest grass? Longest roots? 
- Repeat as necessary to compare results. 

**Talk about one or more of these things:**
- How is the grass helping the soil? If it has fairly long roots (as will be found in native grasses), chances are its holding the soil firmly in place to prevent soil erosion. 
- Is the grass competing with any other plants? 
    - What is the closest plant next to it? 
    - Does it appear to be worse/better off or the same?
- How diverse is the area surrounding your grass stalk
    - How many different things are growing next to your grass?

**You can do this activity in winter too. Even though the grass may appear dead, it is very much alive underneath within its root system**
