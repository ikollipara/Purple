# How to think like a scientist

> Science is for everyone. 
> Small questions can have BIG answers.  

## The Scientific Method

This beautiful thing about the scientific method is that its super easy to use! (Just four steps.)

1. Make an observation.
2. Come up with an explanation for why your observation is the way it is (hypothesis).
3. Test your hypothesis.
4. Analyze your results and come to a conclusion.

**Example:** 
1. Observation: There is ice on the ground outside today.
3. Hypothesis: There is ice outside because it is cold. 
4. Testing your hypothesis: Let's write down the temperature for when there is ice outside and when there isn't.
5. Analyzing your results: When it is below 32 degrees Fahrenheit, ice is present outside.

## As you can see, being a scientist does not only happen in the lab. In fact, there are many aspects of our life in which we can use the scientific method.

* Relationships - How should we interact with people?
* School - What is the best way to study?
* Career choice - What job suits my interests the best? How can I get better at my job?
* Identity of self - Who am I? What do I like to do and not like to do?
* Art - Is my creative medium of choice effective towards my end goal?

## Science and Religion

The scientific method is not suitable for understanding of religious matters. Science is a way to explore the world God created and God operates outside of this world! Therefore, we cannot use the scientific method to figure out how God works. The truth of God revealed to us comes through faith in Christ Jesus. 

Science is a gift from God. A gift of exploration. A gift of wonder in Him and His creation. 



## How to instill postive scientific reasoning in kids

Practice and use intentional observation skills 

Ask open-ended questions 
- Why do you think that works like that?
- Whats one thing we could have done differently?


Encourage finding the answer to their questions. 
- It may be uncomfortable to admit we don't know something obvious. Let's explore that together and learn something new. 

Point out when the child is being a diligent scientist
- I really like how you are thinking about that. That's a good observation! I love how you tested your hypothesis.
