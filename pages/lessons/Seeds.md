# Seeds and Fruit

## Engage: What are pine cones? 
Let's start off with what we know about pine cones
1. They come from pine trees
2. They're fun to decorate with
3. They can be kinda annoying if they're all over your yard or the parkinglot

>Fun fact: Pine cones have often been used by people in temperate climates to predict dry and wet weather, usually hanging a harvested pine cone from some string outside to measure the humidity of the air.

What do they do for trees biologically-speaking? 
- They are protectors of the seeds!
- The pinecones we see are only the female cones.
- The male cones are much smaller and not showy.

Does this mean we can plant a pinecone in the ground and watch it grow?
- No, unfortunately it doesn't work like that
- The cone is actually not the seed at all
- The cone is a "fruit" structure that nurtures two pine seeds between each pointed or prickly scale of the cone. 

So why do trees need another structure just to protect their seeds?

- If the tree wants its seeds to 'go out into the world' it needs a structure that will be able to roll with the wind while still keeping the seed safe. 
- The pine cone is perfect for that - in fact pine cones start at the top of the tree so they can go further when they are dropped to the ground.

## Go outside:
Take a walk and gather pine cones.
Record the weather of the day and whether pine cones are open or closed. 

> Pine cones respond to humidity (the amount of water vapor in the air). When rain and cold are coming the pine cone will close. When the rain stops and the sun dries any moisture in the air, the pine cone will reopen.

If pine cones are open, you might be able to gather seeds. 
- To gather seeds, tip pine cone upside down and tap on a hard surface. 
- The seed in pine cones can usually be identified by the prominent-looking wing, which is attached to the seed for aid in dispersal.

## Questions: 

- How many different kinds of pine cones did you find? What do they have in common? What is different about them? Any reason why they might *need* to be different?
- What was the weather like on the day you collected them and what did you notice about the pine cones? 
- Why would pine cones be closed when its cold outside?
    - In order for the seed to be successful, it must only be released when the conditions are right! Therefore, when it is cold, the pine cone will not let out the seed because that would not give it the best chance for survival. 
- What is one way pine cones are good for the environment?
    - As pine cones break down, they release nutrients that can be beneficial to your plants.
