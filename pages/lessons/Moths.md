# Moths


## Engage: Predator and Prey relationship
**What's a super power you wish you had?**

- Moths have the superpower of invisibility but not in the way you might think... after all you can still see them, right?

To understand this, we will first look at bats (Predator) which eat moths (Prey). 
- Bats see with their ears (echolocation). If you gave bats headphones, they would stumble over things and would have trouble knowing where to go. 
- Moths have a special "invisibility cloak” that absorbs high-pitched sounds. It’s essentially like putting a blindfold AND headphones on the bats. There’s no way a bat could find them now.

## Go Outside
**Activity** *(2+ people)*: 
Define parameters/boundaries. Divide group into moths and bats. There should be more moths than bats if possible. Moths need to stick together in a group. Bats need to have blindfolds but can rely on sound to find their prey (similar to MarcoPolo but the word the bats’ call could be any number of things). Bats can also rely on each other to help find the moths  - ex: “they’re over here.” Time how long it takes for the bats to catch the moths. 
 *Adjust boundaries, number of moths/bats etc. and see if the time increases or decreases.*

## Questions:
- Ask participants what went well and what didn’t.
- How were moths able to get away from the bats?
- Do you think if the boundaries changed, it would be harder or easier for the bats to find the moths?
- Would there be any other tools that the moths could use to hide?

## Let’s look at another way moths avoid predators

What are other predators of moths that don't rely on hearing through sound - and can find their prey easily through sight?
- Examples: lizards, small rodents, skunks, etc. 

**Brainstorm ways moths could defend themselves against a given predator that uses sight:** Examples could include outrunning them, fighting them, etc.
