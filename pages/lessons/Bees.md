# Bees
## Engage: What would it "bee" like to "bee" a bee?

> #### In order to understand the nature of bees, we must first find the similarities and differences between bees and humans. 
> 
> - Helps children think more conceptually about the functionality of bee structures and how these structures help them survive. 
> - This compare and contrast method is useful for developing a child's empathy for and understanding of nature. 


What are some similarities bees have to humans?
- Both have eyes and legs 

What are the functions of these similarities?
- Eyes help us see. Legs help us walk/crawl

What are some differences between bees and humans?
- Insects have 6 legs. Humans have 2 legs.

Introduce new concept: Bees see things differently than you!!!
- Humans see red, blue and green light
- Bees see blue, green and ultraviolet (UV) light
- This means Bees don't see red

## Go Outside
Activity: With a piece of paper, write down 3-5 colors and match them to a different color. (Ex: red is now blue). Go outside and try to picture the world through your new lense. 

**Questions:** 
- What was the difficulty of trying to change the color in your mind?
- Would there be a certain advantage of being able to see things differently than your neighbor. What about another animal? (Ex: You could find food or shelter that someone else might ignore)
- How might this advantage help you survive?

## Engage: How do bees communicate?
> Hint: if you want to get kids interested in bees, don't start out telling them that they are "good for the environment" but rather that "They like to dance! Do any of you like to dance?"

- What are some of the ways *you* communicate?
    - ex: talking, smiling, crying etc. 
- What does your communication let the other person know?
    - ex: your emotions - happy, sad etc.
- You can also communicate information about where food is.
- I bet you could all do it right now: "Food is in the fridge!" or "Food is at the grocery store!"
- What if your food was outside? What if you didn't know where to get food and you had to rely on someone else to tell you?

## Go Outside
### Activity - The Waggle Dance
> People: 3 - 7
> 
> This works best in an area where you could hide an object out of sight  such as a tall grass prairie or a forested area.
1. Decide on an object to be your 'food' item - ex: a ball
2. Pick one person to be the leader/dancer
    - Their job is too hide the item without the others looking.
    - The dance has certain rules:
        - Hands must be behind your back 
        - No pointing or talking
        - Dancing must indicate where the food might be
        - Can't leave the circle (step 3)
3. Everyone else gets in a circle around the leader
4. Let the leader dance for however long to the best of your judgement (maybe 30 seconds)
5. Let the group go and try to find the food
6. Whoever finds it first has to explain what about the leader's dance helped them know what direction to go in.
7. Repeat as wanted


**Questions:**
- What were some hints the leader gave that helped you find the food?
    - ex: the leader running to the side of the circle and jumping up and down let us know where the food was
- What's one thing that would have helped you find the food easier?
- Do you think after a while of somebody doing the exact same dance, you would understand what they meant by it?
- Why do we care about bee behavior?
