# Grass

>Objective: learners will explore the importance of a diverse grass system. 

Fun Fact: 20% of the earth is grass!

## Engage: Monoculture vs Diversity

> We can understand the importance of biodiversity by first looking at other types of diversity such as diversity with food. 


Think of your favorite candy (m&ms, skittles, etc.) Why is it your favorite? 
- What would you do if you no longer has access to this candy?

>The truth is we as human beings love diversity. Nobody wants to eat the same meal day in and day out, and although we have routine, variety is the "spice of life."

**How does nature mirror the the importance of diversity? In other words, why is diversity in nature important?**

- By having a variety of species in both plant and animal communities, organisms rely on each other for survival. If one organism were to become extinct, the rest would still be able to survive. However if a whole phylum (such as all grasses) were removed, there would probably be significant consequences. 

What is the importance of grass?
- Herbivores use grass as a food source and also as part of their habitat which can protect them from predators.


Grass is incredibly diverse but it might not always be. 
- Humans control a majority of what is planted. Are native grasses a priority?

>I would argue that the grass isn't always *greener* where you water it but it should be more interesting!


## Go Outside: 

**Pull a stalk of grass out of the ground carefully to preserve its roots**

Materials: A tape measure, pen and paper
- Measure the length of the roots 
- Observe what soil it's in and surrounding organisms
- Have fun with friendly competition - who can find the tallest grass? Longest roots? 
- Repeat as necessary to compare results. 


Observe how non-native grasses crowd out native grasses and discourage plant diversity

>The location of a species depends on the environment, such as soil type, terrain, and water conditions.


>You can do this activity in winter too. Even though the grass may appear dead, it is very much alive underneath within its root system

## Questions:
- How is the grass helping the soil? 
    - If it has fairly long roots (as will be found in native grasses), chances are its holding the soil firmly in place to prevent soil erosion. 
- Is the grass competing with any other plants? 
    - What is the closest plant next to it? 
    - Does it appear to be worse/better off or the same?
- How diverse is the area surrounding your grass stalk
    - How many different things are growing next to your grass?
    - Do you think different organisms prefer different types of grass? Why or why not?
- How many different types of grass are in your own yard at your house? 
    - Do you like how it looks or do you wish it was different? Why?
