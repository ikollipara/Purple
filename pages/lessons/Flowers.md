# Flowers

>Knowledge of flower anatomy, while certainly important, is not as vital to the experience of biology as is touching flowers, dissecting them and discovering for yourself the connection between structure and function i.e., the purpose of flowers to the environment. They are more than just "pretty".


## Life Cycle of Flowers


### Engage: 
Show two pictures of Dandelions at opposite stages.
- What do these pictures have in common? Different?
- Why do you think they are the same or different?
- Does the difference have to do with function? Why do you think that is?

## Go Outside:
On a nature walk, take note of how many dandelions you see. Do they occur in clusters? Note the different stages that you see. 

* This is a great opportunity to explain the parts of the flower by letting kids explore for themselves and ask their own questions. 
     - Point out that an individual seed is found at the end of the pappus (the white fluffy stuff)
     - The pappus is a helpful appendage that allows the seed to fly through wind. It is important that the seed gets away from its parent plant so that it can start its own family. This prevents the two families from having to fight for resources. 

**Did you know:** All parts of a dandelion are *edible*? Maybe don't mention this to kids in case you are concerned about the possible outcomea. But if you're an adventurous spirit, I would tell you to go for it!
