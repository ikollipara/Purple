>Not every child has the predilection to become a naturalist. All we can do is to teach by example of our own attention and wonder. 

#### *Beyond Ecophobia* by David Sobel

- The best place to learn about the environment is in the natural environment. (Place-based learning)
- Many students benefit from open and focused explorations in a natural setting. 
- Playful learning opportunities can increase interest and excitement in science. 
- By allowing kids opportunity to reflect and explain, they can start to understand their natural surrounding as a context for learning. (Inquiry-based learning)





**Lets teach kids to love, think and act locally, promoting empathy and exploration before attempting to solve the world's problems**
