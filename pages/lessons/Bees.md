# Bees
> Objective: Learners will understand nature of bees by comparing and contrasting bees to humans through sight and though communication. Bees have different bodily structures than humans which yields different functions. These functions are necessary for bees' survival.

## Engage: What would it "bee" like to "bee" a bee?



> To understand the nature of bees, we must first find the similarities and differences between bees and humans.

**Click the arrow to reveal answer**

What are some similarities bees have to humans?
- Both have eyes and legs


What are the functions of these similarities?

- Eyes help us see 
- Legs help us walk


What are some differences between bees and humans?
- Insects have 6 legs. Humans have 2 legs.


Introduce new concept: Bees see things differently than you!!!
- Humans see red, blue and green light
- Bees see blue, green and ultraviolet (UV) light
- This means Bees don't see red

Because flowers look like a big bullseye to bees, bees can find their food much easier! We as humans don't need this adaptation because flowers are not the only part of our diet. Another reason why its essential for bees to find flowers is because they can then act as pollinators - increasing the survival of these immobile flowers.

>Watch [How To See Like An Animal ](https://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsN61OR2pA) (5 min video with activity at the end). Talks about how other animals see things differently.

## Go Outside
Activity: With a piece of paper, write down 3-5 colors and match them to a different color. (Ex: red is now blue). Go outside and try to picture the world through your new lense. 




## Questions: 
- What was the difficulty of trying to change the color in your mind?
- Would there be a certain advantage of being able to see things differently than your neighbor. What about another animal? (Ex: You could find food or shelter that someone else might ignore)
- How might this advantage help you survive?

## Engage: How do bees communicate?
> Hint: if you want to get kids interested in bees, don't start out telling them that they are "good for the environment" but rather that "They like to dance! Do any of you like to dance?"

- What are some of the ways *you* communicate?
    - ex: talking, smiling, crying etc. 
- What does your communication let the other person know?
    - ex: your emotions - happy, sad etc.
- You can also communicate information about where food is.
- I bet you could all do it right now: "Food is in the fridge!" or "Food is at the grocery store!"
- What if your food was outside? What if you didn't know where to get food and you had to rely on someone else to tell you?

## Go Outside
### Activity - The Waggle Dance
> People: 3 - 7
> 
> This works best in an area where you could hide an object out of sight  such as a tall grass prairie or a forested area.
1. Decide on an object to be your 'food' item - ex: a ball
2. Pick one person to be the leader/dancer
    - Their job is to hide the item without the others looking.
    - The dance has certain rules:
        - Hands must be behind your back 
        - No pointing or talking
        - Dancing must indicate where the food might be
        - Can't leave the circle (step 3)
3. Everyone else gets in a circle around the leader
4. Let the leader dance for however long to the best of your judgement (maybe 30 seconds)
5. Let the group go and try to find the food
6. Whoever finds it first has to explain what about the leader's dance helped them know what direction to go in.
7. Repeat as wanted

## Questions:
- What were some hints the leader gave that helped you find the food?
  - ex: the leader running to the side of the circle and jumping up and down let us know where the food was


- What's one thing that would have helped you find the food easier?
- Do you think after a while of somebody doing the exact same dance, you would understand what they meant by it?
- Why do we care about bee behavior?
