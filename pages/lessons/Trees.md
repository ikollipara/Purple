# Trees

## Engage: A tree breathes 
Objective: Learners will understand that a tree uses stomata and lenticels to exchange gas. Learners will be able to explore nature and find lenticels for themselves while also exploring other tree facts.   

**Let's all take a deep breath in and a deep breath out.**
Did you know plants help us breathe? 
How does that process work? 
- Plants release the oxygen that we breathe. We breathe out carbon dioxide that the plants use.

What are some ways we take in oxygen?
- We can exchange gas through 2 ways: our noses and  our mouths!

**How do plants take up the gas that we give them? Do they have noses and mouths like we do?** 

Plants also have 2 structures to take in and release gasses:

1. Stomatas: These are super tiny openings in the leaves
2. Lenticels: These are openings in the bark of the tree. These are visible on most trees!


## Go Outside:
**Find which trees have visible lenticels and which ones don't** 
(See picture for reference. Each raised pore is a lenticel)

While on your hunt for visible lenticels, now would be a perfect time for other tree adventures...

### Let's talk scars and age
Have you ever gotten a scar? How old were you when it happened? 
- Did you know trees get scars too? 

>Every year, a newly emerging growth breaks through its protective terminal bud scales. When these scales fall off as the new growth emerges, they leave a region of terminal bud scale *scars* behind. Regions between terminal bud scale scars represent one year of growth.



- Every year of growth results in a scar because the old is being replaced with the new.
- Does anyone know what this scar looks like? It looks like squished up socks! (Like how if you're wearing long socks, they sometimes fall down and get all squished up at the bottom.)

This is called the terminal bud scale scar. Between each of these scars is one year of growth.

## Go Outside: 

Count *"How Old the Tree Is"* based on the number of scars you see. You will be able to find these scars on smaller branches such as twigs. Keep in mind this isn't an accurate representation of how old the tree is but it does give us an idea about the most recent years of growth.

### Questions:
- Was the length different between the scars? 
    - Why do you think that is? (Maybe there was a longer winter one year or a shorter spring)
- How big around was the tree or twig when you looked at the scars?
    - Why would size around (circumference) the branch matter given how much growth it had in the past year? Do you think the two are related?
- Besides lenticels and the terminal bud scale scars, did you see anything else interesting?

**What does this tell us about trees... its more than just growth. It also tells us that God cares about us knowing this information. Why would God want us to know how old trees are?**




## Engage: Toys and Trees?

Let's start off by talking about toys...

Toys are great! But do we want them to be everywhere all the time? If toys are all over our floor, we might step on them trying to get to our bed! Ouch!

Now let's think about trees. Trees and toys? Those don't have anything in common?!

Toys are fun to play with and trees give us wood and a beautiful landscape but neither of these things should be everywhere all of the time. 

What's one instance where it wouldn't be good to have a tree?
- Maybe a desert? How about a tree growing through the middle of your living room through the floorboards and up through the roof? 

**Now, how about a prairie?** Do trees belong *there*?

## Go Outside (specifically to a tallgrass prairie):
Have learners roam the prairie see what they observe

>Trees are great but we don't want them everywhere

What are some aspects of a prairie?
- Vegetation: Tall grass, 
Trees don't belong in prairies because large animals (think buffalo) have to roam through this space, they would *bonk* into the trees. 

At the prairie - count the number of trees in it. 

Questions:
- Do these trees occur in patches? How tall are the trees?
-
