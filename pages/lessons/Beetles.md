# Beetles

### How do you clean your room? Are you a roller, tunnuler, or dweller?



**Rollers:** If you clean your room by categorizing your items into neat balls and putting them in their separate compartments…

**Tunnelers:** if you clean your room by stuffing all your stuff under the bed… 

**Dwellers:** if you don’t clean your room at all and instead enjoy the mess… 

**Just like there are different ways to clean your room, dung beetles have different behaviors** 

What is meant by cleaning your room? It may sound gross, but dung beetles recycle waste left behind by other organisms. 

1. Dung beetles are extremely beneficial to the environment! 
2. While it may take other organisms days, maybe even years to clean their rooms, beetles do it in only 48 hours! 
3. They make the world a less smelly place to live…otherwise we’d be overrun by flies, parasites and pests that also spend their time in dung piles. 

### Go outside: 
- Without looking up a picture: what do you think dung beetles would need to look like? 
- What features would they need to have to do the work they do? 

**Think of places you could find beetles. What kind of habitat would they enjoy?** 
- Find a leaf 
- Does it look like it’s been eaten by a beetle? 

#### The Japanese beetle is a highly destructive and invasive beetle in Nebraska 
- It can eat the whole leaf sometimes, only leaving 
- This can sometimes stress and kill the plant.

### Beetles and Dirt
Objective: What is the relationship between biodiversity of nonliving things (such as dirt) and beetles?

**Activity:** Obtain a hollow object with a semi large circumference ex: a hoola hoop. Place the object on the  ground and see how many different things (biodiveristy) you can find. 
- See if you can identify the different types of beetle behavior 
- How many living things are there?
- How many nonliving things are there?
- Describe the interactions between the living and nonliving things.
