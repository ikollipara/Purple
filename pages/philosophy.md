# Philosophy of Facing Fear

> Certainly there are plenty of things in this world we can be scared of and part of that is natural - we want to avoid the things that can hurt us. However, being cautious is different than being afraid. Wouldn't we rather be curious about our world than hiding from it?

## Being *cautious* is different than being *afraid*:
- Driving can put people in danger, but because you still need to get to certain places, the risk is worth it. 
- Nature is no different
- If you value being outside and discovering the beauty of God's creation, you might need to step out of your comfort zone. 

## Wouldn't we rather be curious?
Curiosity may have killed the cat, but it doesn't have to kill you. 
- As humans, our curiosity was hightened as children. This was how we interacted with the world
- Has our curiosity in life diminished as we've gotten older?
- The benefit of curiosity is wonder. With wonder comes a joy and appreciation for what God has provided us. 

## Nature can be scary... what do we do?

1. Confront the issue (Try to not flinch when you see a bug... could you hold it in your hand?)
2. Lets change the way we think about it
    - Instead of "That's SO gross" try "I wonder why God made that organism"
3. Witness how others may act around that organism
    - Is it a fearless child? What about zoo keepers?


What is it that WE can do to help the future generations be less fearless of nature?
